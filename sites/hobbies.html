          Ever since I was still a kid I really liked playing games especially on the computer with a keyboard and mouse. From the momment I first handled a computer, I knew this was for me. This is one of my hobbies because of the fun and happiness it has brought to my life.

          Growing up I witnessed cooking from friends and family alike especially during events like birthdays etc. this leads me to curiousity on how it is done, so now most of the time I am the one cooking here at our house mostly for the family.

          Another hobby of mine is sleeping, but it really is napping. Throughout the day I take some power naps, may it be a short period of time about 5 minutes up to a 30 minutes even an house especially during weekends or days without class. This helps me speed through the day and keep me well rested and full of energy.
